## Dataset Title
LinearStrengthLateralStressAluminumData.csv

## Description: 
This dataset contains numerical values of key geometric and physical parameters from a high-throughput ab initio study that investigates the linear relationship of ideal strength with lateral stress under 0-600 GPa in Aluminum, authored by Lin Zhang, Tianle Wang, and Feng Liu. 
This is a placeholder description and data until the manuscript is officially accepted and published. 
The data is posed for transparency and scientific reproducibility, including the results of DFT (Density Functional Theory) calculations.

## Dataset Overview
- a(Å): Unit cell length along the a-axis in Angstroms.
- c(Å): Unit cell length along the c-axis in Angstroms.
- F1: First component of the deformation gradient corresponding to unit cell length 'a'.
- F3: Third component of the deformation gradient corresponding to unit cell length 'c'.
- E1: Lagrangian strain component associated with length 'a'.
- E3: Lagrangian strain component associated with length 'c'.
- Sigma1(GPa): Cauchy stress along the 'a' axis in GigaPascals.
- Sigma3(GPa): Cauchy stress along the 'c' axis in GigaPascals.
- ΔE(ev): Relative energy change compared to a reference state in electron volts.

## Use Guidance
- Format Provided: The data is provided in CSV format, suitable for analyses with various software tools including Python (with libraries like Pandas), MATLAB, R, or for visualization in Excel, etc.
- Typical Analysis: Sample analysis can include constructing scatter plots of deformation gradient components against unit cell lengths as well as Lagrangian strain components. These may provide insights into the material behavior under different stress conditions.
